# 👋 About Me
**Batch of 2019, EEE** I am currently working as a **Battery Systems Engineer** at Tesla's Gigafactory in Nevada. My work primarily focuses on the thermal management systems for the Model 3 and Y battery packs. Before joining Tesla, I completed my MS in Energy Systems from Stanford University.

At NIT Calicut, I was deeply involved in the **Robotics Interest Group (RIG)** and worked on several projects involving BMS (Battery Management Systems) for the solar car team. I'm passionate about sustainable energy and helping juniors navigate the transition from college to core engineering industries.

## 🎓 Career & Further Studies

### Q: How did you decide between a Job vs. a Master's immediately after B.Tech?
I actually worked for one year at a consultancy firm in Bangalore before applying for my Master's.

* **Why I chose a Master's:** I realized that to get into R&D roles in core companies (like Tesla, Apple, or Rimac), a specialized depth of knowledge is often required. Undergraduate courses cover the breadth, but a Master's gave me the specific skills in *Electrochemical Storage* and *Control Theory* that I use daily.
* **Advice:** If you are 100% sure about your niche, you can go directly. If you are unsure, working for 1-2 years gives you clarity and makes your SOP (Statement of Purpose) much stronger.

### Q: What colleges/courses should EEE students target for EV roles?
For Electric Vehicles, you want programs that blend **Power Electronics**, **Control Systems**, and **Embedded Systems**.
* **Top US Schools:** Stanford, Georgia Tech, Purdue, and UM Ann Arbor (strong automotive ties).
* **Top European Schools:** TU Delft (Netherlands) and RWTH Aachen (Germany) are excellent and often more affordable.

## ⚡ Industry Insights

### Q: What does a "Battery Engineer" actually do day-to-day?
It's not just sitting at a desk! My week is split 60/40 between simulation and the lab.
* **Simulation:** Using **MATLAB/Simulink** to model how the battery behaves under extreme heat or cold.
* **Testing:** We physically crash, heat, and age battery cells to validate our models.
* **Cross-functional work:** I talk to the Mechanical team (cooling pipes) and the Firmware team (coding the BMS) constantly.

### Q: What are the specific technical skills Tesla looks for?
When I interview interns, I look for three things beyond just grades:
1.  **First Principles Thinking:** Can you derive *why* a circuit works, rather than just remembering the formula?
2.  **Hands-on Projects:** Did you build a BMS? Did you design a buck converter? I want to see dirty hands and burnt components—it shows you tried.
3.  **Tool Proficiency:**
    * **Hardware:** Altium (PCB Design), Oscilloscopes.
    * **Software:** Python (for data analysis), C/C++ (for embedded), and Simulink.

## 💡 Advice for NITC Students

### Q: What should I focus on in my 3rd and 4th year?
* **Don't ignore the labs:** The Machines Lab and Power Electronics Lab are old-school, but the fundamentals you learn there (like torque-speed characteristics) are asked in interviews.
* **Build a Portfolio:** Don't just list projects on a resume. Create a GitHub repo or a simple website documenting *how* you built it, the failure points, and the final result.
* **Network:** Reach out to alumni on LinkedIn. Don't ask "Can you give me a referral?" straight away. Ask specific questions about their work. We are usually happy to help!

> **Final thought:** The EV industry is booming. Don't be afraid to aim for "Dream Companies" straight out of Kerala. The foundation we get at NITC is solid enough to compete globally.
